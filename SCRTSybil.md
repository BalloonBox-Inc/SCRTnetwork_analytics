## Project Description 
Project name: SCRTSybil

SCRTSybil is an oracle for credit score checks. The objective of SCRTSybil is to return a quantifiable, yet private and encrypted credit score for SCRT network users allowing to categorize users by credibility and trustworthiness within the ecosystem. Credit checks will incentivize the activity of new, yet trusted and verified SCRT network users, while also affirming the reputation of long-standing users.
 
## Problem / Solution  
How can one validate the trustworthiness of blockchain users, while maintaining user privacy? Our project consists in building a SCRT oracle, called SCRTSybil, for decentralized credit scoring. We will build TLS connections from on-chain validator enclaves to APIs, creating private credit check scores for secret contracts. These APIs will aggregate a user’s credit data from web3 (wallet balance and transaction history in at least 2 cryptocurrency exchange platforms of their choice, e.g., Coinbase, Binance, Stripe) with web 2 data (bank account balance, credit history on Plaid, Trulioo). The credit check outcome will be quantified via a credit scoring algorithm we’ll design. This algorithm integrates web2&web3 validation of a user’s financial standing. Validated private data feed, i.e., the actual credit score will be stored on-chain and can be accessed via a privately issued secret key.
